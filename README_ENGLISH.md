## Project Description
This data analysis project aims to **optimize the marketing strategies** for an online retail business. The company has faced a **reduction in customer engagement** and **decreased conversion rates**, despite launching several new online marketing campaigns. The analysis seeks to identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies and provide data-driven solutions to enhance customer engagement and conversion rates.

## Key Points of the Analysis
- **Reduced Customer Engagement**: A decline in the number of interactions with the website and marketing content.
- **Decreased Conversion Rates**: Fewer site visitors are converting into paying customers.
- **High Marketing Expenses**: Marketing campaigns are not generating the expected returns.
- **Need for Customer Feedback Analysis**: Understanding customer opinions is crucial for improving satisfaction and conversion.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: SQL was used to perform queries and extract relevant data from the database, enabling analysis of engagement trends and conversion rates.
- **Python**: A column for **customer sentiment** was generated based on customer ratings using sentiment analysis in Python. This helped identify positive and negative patterns in customer reviews.
- **Power BI**: SQL scripts and the table generated in Python were imported into Power BI to create visualizations and conduct a detailed analysis as requested by the client.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction with SQL**:
   - SQL queries were used to retrieve data on customer engagement, conversion rates, and customer feedback.
   - The queries focused on identifying products with the best and worst conversion rates, as well as key dates for campaigns and events.

2. **Sentiment Analysis with Python**:
   - A **sentiment column** was created using Python, based on customer ratings.
   - The sentiment analysis provided deeper insights into the positive and negative perceptions customers had about the products.

3. **Visualization and Analysis in Power BI**:
   - The processed data was integrated into **Power BI** to create interactive visualizations showcasing trends in engagement, conversion, and customer feedback.
   - The analysis revealed key insights that formed the basis for improvement recommendations.

## Results and Recommendations
- **Increase Conversion Rates**:
   - **Focus on High-Performing Product Categories**: Direct marketing efforts towards products with high conversion rates, such as kayaks, ski boots, and baseball gloves. Implement seasonal promotions during peak months (e.g., January and September) to capitalize on these trends.

- **Enhance Customer Engagement**:
   - **Revitalize Content Strategy**: To reverse the decline in views and low interaction rates, experiment with more engaging content formats, such as interactive videos and user-generated content. Boost engagement by optimizing call-to-action placement in social media and blog content, especially during months of historically lower engagement (September-December).

- **Improve Customer Feedback Scores**:
   - **Address Mixed and Negative Feedback**: Implement a process for analyzing mixed and negative reviews to identify common issues. Develop improvement plans to address these concerns. Consider following up with dissatisfied customers to resolve issues and encourage re-rating, aiming to move the average ratings closer to the 4.0 target.

## Conclusion
This project helped identify critical areas for improving ShopEasy’s marketing strategies, providing a data-driven action plan to enhance customer engagement, increase conversion rates, and improve product perception. By combining SQL, Python, and Power BI, a comprehensive view of the client's situation was obtained, enabling strategic interventions.
